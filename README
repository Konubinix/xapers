Xapers
======

Xapers is a document indexing system, geared towards academic papers.
It provides fast search of document text and bibliographic data synced
from online libraries, and simple document retrieval for viewing.

Xapers takes as input document files and source identifiers.  These
are then parsed and indexed into a Xapian database [0].  The document
text is extracted and fully indexed, while the source identifier is
used to download document metadata from the web, as bibtex [1], which
is parsed and indexed to prefixed terms in the database.  Documents
can be arbitrarily tagged.  Bibtex for groups of documents can be
exported.

It provides source modules for some common online libraries:
  * DOI        http://www.doi.org/
  * NASA ADS   http://www.adsabs.harvard.edu/
  * arXiv      http://arxiv.org/
Source modules are extensible, so user-defined modules can be easily
maintained.  Contributions are encouraged.

See the included man page for usage information.

Xapers is heavily inspired by the notmuch mail indexing system [0].

Source
------

Clone the repo:

$ git clone git://finestructure.net/xapers

Requirements
------------

Xapers requires:

  * python (>= 2.6)
  * python-xapian - Python Xapian bindings
  * python-urwid - Python urwid curses library bindings
  * pybtex - Python bibtex parser

Tests
-----

Run the tests:

$ ./test/xapers-test

Debian
------

Debian/Ubuntu snapshot packages can be easily made from the git
source:

$ make debian-snapshot

The resulting .deb will be in the 'build' directory.


Using Xapers
============

Included is a simple example of an import script ("xapers-importer")
that can be used e.g. as pdf handler in your favorite browser.  It's
display the pdf according to mailcap rules, then presents the user
with a dialog to add source id and tags.  If the source id is know,
bibtex is retrieved and the resulting xapers entry for the document is
displayed.

Development of more clever import methods is HIGHLY encouraged.

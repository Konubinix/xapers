Xapers
======

Xapers is a document indexing system, geared towards academic papers.
It provides fast search of document text and bibliographic data
(synced from online libraries) and simple document and bibtex
retrieval.

Xapers takes as input document files (as pdf) and source identifiers.
These are then parsed and indexed into a Xapian database [0].
Document text is extracted from the pdf and fully indexed, while the
source identifier is used to download document metadata from the web,
as bibtex [1], which is parsed and indexed to prefixed terms in the
database.  Documents can be arbitrarily tagged.  Bibtex for groups of
documents can be exported.

Xapers provides source modules for some common online libraries:
  * DOI        http://www.doi.org/
  * NASA ADS   http://www.adsabs.harvard.edu/
  * arXiv      http://arxiv.org/
Source modules are meant to be extensible, so hopefully we will be
able to support user-defined modules in the futre.  Contributions are
very much appreciated.

See the included man page for usage information.

Xapers is heavily inspired by the notmuch mail indexing system [0].

Source
------

Clone the repo:

$ git clone git://finestructure.net/xapers

Requirements
------------

Xapers requires:

  * python (>= 2.6)
  * python-xapian - Python Xapian bindings
  * python-urwid - Python urwid curses library bindings
  * pybtex - Python bibtex parser

Tests
-----

Run the tests:

$ ./test/xapers-test

Debian
------

Debian/Ubuntu snapshot packages can be easily made from the git
source:

$ make debian-snapshot

The resulting .deb will be in the 'build' directory.


Using Xapers
============

CLI
---

See the included man page (xapers.1) for more information on the
command line interface.

Also included is a simple example of an import script
("xapers-importer") that help in importing documents into the
database.  It can be used e.g. as a pdf handler in your favorite
browser.  It displays the pdf according to mailcap rules, then
presents the user with prompts to import the document into Xapers, any
source id to retrieve, and any initial tags to add.  If the source id
is know, bibtex is retrieved and indexed.  The resulting xapers entry
for the document is displayed.

Development of more clever import methods is highly encouraged.

Python library
--------------

>>> import xapers
>>> db = xapers.Database('~/.xapers/docs')
>>> docs = db.search('tag:new')
>>> for doc in docs:
        doc.add_tags(['foo'])
        ...
>>>

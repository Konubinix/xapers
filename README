Xapers
======

Xapers is a document indexing system, geared towards academic journal
articles.  Think of it as a local cache of online libraries.  It
provides fast search of document text and bibliographic data and
simple document and bibtex retrieval.

Document files (in PDF format) and source identifiers (e.g. DOI) are
parsed and indexed into a Xapian search engine [0].  Document text is
extracted from the PDF and fully indexed.  Bibliographic information
downloaded from online libraries is indexed as prefixed search terms.
Documents can be arbitrarily tagged.  Original document files are
easily retrievable from a simple curses search UI.  The command line
interface allows for exporting bibtex [1] from arbitrary searches,
allowing seamless integration into LaTeX work flows.

Xapers provides source modules for some common online libraries:

  * DOI        http://www.doi.org/
  * arXiv      http://arxiv.org/

Contributions of additional library interface modules is highly
encouraged.

Xapers is heavily inspired by the notmuch mail indexing system [2].

Using Xapers
============

CLI
---

The main interface to Xapers is the xapers command line utility.  From
this interface you can import documents, search, tag, etc.

See the included xapers(1) man page for detailed usage and information
on source modules and searching.

Also included is a simple example of an import script
("xapers-importer") that helps in the importing of documents.  It can
be used e.g. as a PDF handler in your favorite browser.  It displays
the PDF then presents the user with the option to import the document
into Xapers, followed by prompts for any source id to retrieve and any
initial tags to add.  If the source id is known, bibtex is retrieved
and indexed.  The resulting xapers entry for the document is
displayed.

Development of more clever import methods is highly encouraged.

Python library
--------------

Xapers is really a python library interface under the hood:

>>> import xapers
>>> db = xapers.Database('~/.xapers/docs')
>>> docs = db.search('tag:new')
>>> for doc in docs:
        doc.add_tags(['foo'])
        ...
>>> 

Development of new interfaces to the underlying library are
highly encouraged.

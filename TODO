db:
* add values: publication date, entry creation time, mod time, etc.
* use bib abstract as data if available?

doc:
* add ability to remove source sid
* add ability to replace/remove file

cli:
* utilize meta-data pulled from parser
* update should re-pull from existing source if available
* export should produce full mirror of xapers document structure
* needs simplification (script + module is clunky)
* improve command line parsing

nci:
* how to test??
* asyncronously load search results
* update/add in search
* better entry highlighting (full entry)
* fail gracefully if db has changed
* customizable keybindings
* customizable palette

sources:
* allow for user source modules (inherit Source)
* add method to download document file

parser:
* extract any metadata from pdfs
* better handle parse errors
* better pdf parser (native python: https://gist.github.com/pazz/5455090)
* parsers for other document types

bib:
* test for compiling bibtex
* do something about "container-title" from doi
* provide bib output in other formats

emacs UI
* make emacs UI! (need json/sexp output)

?
* rename file when importing and copying into docdir?
* store bib in different form (json instead of bibtex)?
* should something other than summary go in document "data"?
* clear old indexed terms when importing new file/bib?
* vcs integration (git of root)?


BUGS
====

* nci: 'b' on doc with no bib produces traceback

* capitalized prefixed terms are not searchable

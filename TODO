bib:
* test for compiling bibtex
* include file path in bibtex
* do something about "container-title" from doi
* provide bib output in other formats

emacs UI
* make emacs UI! (need json/sexp output)

?
* rename file when importing and copying into docdir?
* store bib in different form (json instead of bibtex)?
* should something other than summary go in document "data"?
* clear old indexed terms when importing new file/bib?
* vcs integration (git of root)?

packaging:

BUGS
====

* nci: 'b' on doc with no bib produces traceback

db:
* add publication date, entry creation time, mod time, etc. as db values

sources:

* allow for user source modules

bib:
* include file path in bibtex
* do something about "container-title" from doi
* provide bib output in other formats

cli:

* update should re-pull from existing source if available
* needs simplification (script + module is clunky)
* improve command line parsing

nci:
* asyncronously load search results
* add update/add command
* better entry highlighting (full entry)
* fail gracefully if db has changed
* customizable keybindings
* customizable palette

emacs UI
* make emacs UI! (need json/sexp output)

?
* rename file when importing and copying into docdir?
* store bib in different form (json instead of bibtex)?
* should something other than summary go in document "data"?
* clear old indexed terms when importing new file/bib?
* vcs integration (git of root)?

packaging:
* set version in setup.py

* add publication date, entry creation time, mod time, etc. as db values
* check for existing source id when importing
* update should re-pull from existing source if available
* import should be able to pull doc file

* source id indexing isn't working quite right (quantify/test!)
* create docdir, add files/bibtex only when syncing

source modules:
* add method to download document file
* allow for user source modules

bib:
* include file path in bibtex
* do something about "container-title" from doi
* provide bib output in other formats

cli:
* needs simplification (script + module is clunky)
* improve command line parsing

curses UI:
* add document updating
* asyncronously load results
* better entry highlighting (full entry)
* customizable keybindings
* customizable palette

emacs UI
* make emacs UI! (need json/sexp output)

?
* rename file when importing?
* store bib in different form (json instead of bibtex)?
* what should go in document "data"?
* clear old indexed terms when importing new file/bib?
* vcs integration (git of root)?

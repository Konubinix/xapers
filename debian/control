Description: Journal article management and indexing system.
 Xapers is a document indexing system, geared towards academic journal
 articles.  Think of it as a local cache of online libraries.  It
 provides fast search of document text and bibliographic data and
 simple document and bibtex retrieval.
 .
 Document files (as pdf) and source identifiers (e.g. DOI) are parsed
 and indexed into a Xapian database.  Document text is extracted from
 the pdf and fully indexed.  Bibliographic information downloaded from
 online libraries is indexed as prefixed search terms.  Documents can
 be arbitrarily tagged.  Original document files are easily
 retrievable from a simple curses search UI.  The command line
 interface allows for exporting bibtex from arbitrary searches,
 allowing seemless integration into LaTeX work flows.

.SH NAME
xapers \- journal article indexing system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xapers
.IR command " [" args " ...]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Xapers is a document indexing system, geared towards academic journal
articles.  It provides fast search of document text and bibliographic
data (synced from online libraries) and simple document and bibtex
retrieval.

Xapers takes as input document files (as PDF) and source identifiers.
Documents are copied into a local document store (~/.xapers/docs by
default) and text is extracted from the PDF and fully indexed into a
textual database.  Source identifiers are used to download document
bibliographic data from the web (see \fBSOURCES\fR below), which is
parsed and indexed to prefixed terms in the database.  The
bibliographic data is also stored as bibtex in the document store for
easy retrieval.  Documents can be arbitrarily tagged.

A curses UI is provided for simple access to documents (see the
\fBview\fR command below).  Xapers is ultimately a document indexing
library, though, so development of alternate user interfaces is
encouraged.

Underlying Xapers is the wonderful Xapian database/search engine.  See
http://xapian.org/ for more information.

.SH MAIN COMMANDS

The following are the main xapers commands.  See \fBSEARCH TERMS\fR
below for details of the supported syntax for <search-terms>.
 
.SS import [options] [[id:]<docid>]
.SS add [options] [[id:]<docid>]
.SS update [options] [[id:]<docid>]

Import a document, or update an existing document.  Must specify one
of --file or --source options when importing.  If an existing document
id (<docid>) is specified as the last argument, the matching document
is updated with newly provided information.  Available options:
.RS 4
.TP 4
.BR \-\-source=<sid>
Source identifier for document.  See \fBSOURCES\fR below.  This may
also be a path to a file that contains a single bibtex entry.
.RE
.RS 4
.TP 4
.BR \-\-file=<path>
Document file (as PDF) to import.  Text of document will be extracted
from PDF and indexed.  A copy of the file will be placed in the Xapers
document store.
.RE
.RS 4
.TP 4
.BR \-\-tags=<tag>[,...]
Initial tags to apply to document.  Multiple tags can be specified,
comma separated.
.RE
.RS 4
.TP 4
.BR \-\-prompt
Prompt user for source/file/tags, if not specified.  When prompting
for source information documents are automatically scanned for source
IDs and found ids are displayed.
.RE
.RS 4
.TP 4
.BR \-\-view
View resulting entry in curses UI when done.  See the \fBviewP\fR
command below for more info.
.RE

.SS tag +<tag>|-<tag> [...] [--] <search-terms>...

Add remove tags from documents.

.SS search [options] <search-terms>...

Search for documents in the database.  Document information is printed
to stdout.
.RS 4
.TP 4
.BR \-\-output=[summary|files|bibtex|sources|tags]

Specify document information to be output:

.B summary
outputs a single-line summary of the document (default).

.B files
outputs the paths in the document store to all files associated with
documents.

.B bibtex
outputs document bibliographic information (if available) as bibtex.

.B sources
outputs all sources associated with documents.

.B tags
outputs all tags associated with documents.

Default is
.B summary.
.RE
.RS 4
.TP 4
.BR \-\-limit=N

Limit number of results returned.  Default is 20.  Use 0 to return all
results.
.RE

.SS bibtex <search-terms>...

Short for "search --output=bibtex <search-terms>...".

.SS count <search-terms>...

Return a simple count of search results.

.SS view [<search-terms>...]
.SS show [<search-terms>...]

View search results in curses search UI.  Documents matching search
are displayed with their bibliographic information and a short text
summary.  It allows for manipulating document tags and for retrieved
for document files and source URLs for viewing (see
.B xdg-open(1)
for more info).  Initial search terms can be provided, but further
searches can be performed from within the UI.  While in the UI type
"?" for available commands.

NOTE: At the moment only the top 20 search results are displayed, due
to synchronous loading restrictions.  This obviously needs to be
fixed.

.SS export <directory> <search-terms>...

Copy PDF files of resulting documents into <directory>, named with
document titles when available.

.SS delete [id:]<docid>

Delete a document from the database.  All document files will purged
from the document store.


.SH SOURCE COMMANDS

These commands provide access to some of the source module methods.  See
\fBSOURCES\fR below.

.SS sources

List available sources.

.SS source2bib <sid>

Retrieve bibtex from source for a specified source id and print to
stdout.

.SS scandoc <file>

Scan a document file for a source ID.

.SH SOURCES

Sources are online databases from which document bibliographic data
can be retrieved.  In Xapers sources are plugin modules that can be
used to retrieve bibliographic data for a given document.

Online libraries are assigned unique prefixes, known internally as
"sources".  Online libraries associate unique document identifiers
("ids") to individual documents.  Xapers then recognizes document
source ids, or \fBsid\fR, of the form "<source>:<id>".

Xapers currently recognizes the following online sources:

    doi:   Digital Object Identifier (DOI) (http://www.doi.org/)
    arxiv: arXiv (http://arxiv.org/)

Xapers allows specifying document source ids as either URLs
(e.g. "http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.29.002092") or sid strings
(e.g. "doi:10.1364/JOSAA.29.002092").  URLs are parsed into sids when
recognized.  The sids are then used to retrieve bibtex from the online
library databases.  The sids for a given document are stored as
indexed terms in the Xapers database.


.SH SEARCH TERMS

Search terms consist of free-form text (and quoted phrases) which will
match all documents that contain all of the given terms/phrases.

As a special case, a search string consisting of a single asterisk
('*') will match all documents in the database.

In addition to free text, the following prefixes can be used to match
text against specific document metadata:

    id:<docid>               document id
    author:<string>          string in authors (also a:)
    title:<string>           string in title (also t:)
    tag:<tag>                user tags
    source:<source>          source type (also s:)

The
.B id:
prefix matches against unique internal integer document identifiers.

The
.B author:
or
.B a:
prefix matches against strings in document author bibliographic data.

The
.B title:
or
.B t:
prefix matches against strings in document title bibliographic data.

The
.B tag:
prefix matches against specific document tags.

The
.B source:
prefix can be used to return all documents from a specified source
(see \fBSOURCES\fR above).


.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables can be used to control the
behavior of xapers:

.SS XAPERS_ROOT
Location of the Xapers document store.  Defaults to "~/.xapers/docs"
if not specified.
